The following is a guide on how to structure your literature review to keep things consistent and make it easier to collaborate and eventually aggregate the reviews for development of the final experiment and paper. All references should be cited (preferably in APA, but IEEE is also fine, I just think it's harder to keep track of numbers than names) 

# Title 

#### By: Insert_Author

### Overview
A description of the kinds of literature that was reviewed and a framing of the tasks, benchmarks and challenges of the subdomain.  

### Past Work
The meat of the review examining the relevant literature to further explore the subdomain. Should consist of about one paragraph per article (not a hard rule) and construct a rough narrative of what's been done, what is being done (what is the State Of The Art for various benchmarks and tasks) and if possible an assessment where the field seems to be headed. 

### Avenues For Inclusion
A short summary of the most relevant algorithms and concepts which you believe to be the most directly applicable to the project. This can then be expanded into different ideas for how this could be integrated with or inform the final experimental design and implementation. 

### References
A bibliography of every source used. These should be primarily academic sources, but exceptions can be made at the authors discretion (citing news stories, quotes, etc)

**NOTE: It's recommended that you try to stick with this rough format, but each review will be different. Some may have very little history but a lot of present activity. Some may be extremely niche making it difficult to relay a SOTA in any meaningful sense. Adapt this format to best deliver the most important information about your literature. Also, try to keep notes on the readings so it's easier for us to collaborate and assist each other**
